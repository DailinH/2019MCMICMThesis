\begin{enumerate}[$\mathcal{A}$1.]
	\item We classify all counties into \textbf{\itshape Producers} and \textbf{\itshape Consumers} basing on their drug sources. Namely, a Producer obtains drug by production, and a Consumer obtains drug by importing them from neighoring counties. We assume that a county could either be a Producer or a Consumer, but not both.
	
	\item A Producer produces drugs at constant rate. A Consumer may change into a Producer, but not vice versa.
	
	\item We define \textbf{\itshape Origin} as the location where certain opioids were first produced. All origins are Producers, but not vice versa.
	
	\item The amount of drug that a county uses per day is relevant to certain socio-economic factors.
	
	\item Opioids can only be transported between neighboring counties in limited time, since illicit narcotics are usually transported through personal vehicles.\cite{9}
