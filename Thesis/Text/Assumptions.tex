\begin{enumerate}[$\mathcal{A}$1.]
	\item We classify all counties into \textbf{\itshape Sources} and \textbf{\itshape Consumers} basing on their opoid sources. A Source obtains opoid by production or import from cities outside the five states, and a Consumer by importing opoid from adjacent counties. A county is either a Source or a Consumer, but not both.
	
	\item A Consumer may change into a Source, and vice versa.
	
	\item We define \textbf{\itshape Origin} as the location where general or certain specific opioids were first produced. All Origins are Sources, but not vice versa.
	
	\item The amount of opoid that a county uses per day is relevant to certain socio-economic factors.
	
	\item Opioids can only be transported between neighboring counties in limited time, since illicit narcotics are usually transported through personal vehicles.\cite{9}
	
	\item For each opoid identification report, the amount of opoid obtained are the same.
