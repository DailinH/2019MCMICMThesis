The use of synthetic and non-synthetic opioids is a national crisis for the US. If the opioid crisis spreads to all cross-sections of the US population, various occupations will be affected, and in turn causing defects for important sectors of the US economy.This crisis includes both prescription and nonprescription (illegal) use of opioid drugs.\cite{1} With the increased availability of both prescribed and illegally obtained opioids over the past 30 years, there has been an increase in misuse and deaths.\cite{2}

Based on the report from Opioid Enforcement Administration's(DEA) Office of Diversion Control, which covers data from crime laboratories that handle over 88\% of the nation's estimated 1.2 billion annual state and local opioid cases, we look into the spread and characteristics of the reported synthetic opioid and heroin incidents in and between Ohio, Kentucky, West Verginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and their counties over time.
